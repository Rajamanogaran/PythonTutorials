The player-character is controlled via the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. While most of Mario's abilities are taken directly from Super Mario  such as the long jump, wall jumps, and a variety of somersaults, a new feature called the Star Pointer, which is a cursor that appears when the Wii Remote pointer is pointed at the screen. Essentially, the Star Pointer is used to pick up special konpeito-shaped objects called "Star Bits", which are then shot to stun enemies, manipulate obstacles, or feed Hungry Lumas (star-shaped sentient beings which act as companions throughout the game). Secondly, the pointer can latch onto small blue objects called "Pull Stars", which can be utilised to pull Mario through space. If the player becomes encased in a floating bubble, the Star Pointer is used to manoeuvre the bubble.

Early into the game, the player learns a new ability known as the "Spin" technique, which has had appearances in varying forms throughout the Super Mario franchise. In Super Mario Galaxy, the "spin" is primarily used for melee attacks, as it can stun enemies and shatter objects, and is used to trigger special propellers called "Sling Stars" or "Launch Stars" that launch Mario across large distances through space. The "spin" utility is also used for climbing vines, ice skating, unscrewing bolts, and for activating several power-ups. Other Wii Remote functions are available for smaller quests, such as surfing aboard a manta ray or balancing atop a large ball and rolling it through
